## About Me

My name is Jun Xiang â€“ but friends call me by my initials: JX. In my free time, I enjoy post-processing in PS, LR, and FCPX. Sometimes, I set up a [virtual instance](https://m.do.co/c/89fd5cb83d53) to deploy OSS from this [list](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) here and destroy them once I have my fun.

I am based in Singapore, and am currently working as a compliance professional in a digital bank.
